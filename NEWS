** fixes

   (None)


** improvements

   (None)


* atat 0.1.0 (2020-??-??)

** Initial version of project.

   The project currently provides a single program, 'atat', and it's man page,
   atat(1).

   The 'atat' program pretty-prints the output of 'at -l' to show at(1) jobs
   in the order in which they will occur, and with the date and time fields
   formatted in a way that is more easily consumed by downstream tools in a
   unix pipeline.
