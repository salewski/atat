* History of 'at' (and friends) on BSD

** 2.11BSD (circa 1992) has pre-Koenig at(1) command

   The 2BSD source line dates originally from 1979, but 2.11BSD was issued
   in 1992. This at.c command /is not/ the version written by Thomas Koenig:

       https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=2.11BSD/src/usr.bin/at/at.c

   Note that the above URL is hosted by The Unix Heritage Society (tuhs.org).

   The copyright notice at the top of the file does not mention anything about
   AT&T:

   #+BEGIN_SRC c

    * All rights reserved.  The Berkeley software License Agreement
    * specifies the terms and conditions for redistribution.
    */
   #+END_SRC

   Compare that with the copyright heading of the file in 4.4BSD.


** 4.4BSD (circa 1993) also has pre-Koenig at(1), now with AT&T tainted copyright note

       https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.4BSD/usr/src/usr.bin/at/at/at.c

   The copyright notice at the top of the file now mentions AT&T:

   Compare that with the copyright heading of the file in the earlier 2.11BSD.

** 1993-08-11: comp.os.linux thread (10 msgs (only 3 relevant)): "[Q] Diffs from SysV specs?"

   This thread had 10 messages in August 1993, but only three of them are
   relevant to the history of the 'at' command in GNU/Linux:

       https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.os.linux/xF3Rc0lZNQY

   A question was asked about a list of programs found Stephen R. Bourne's
   book "The UNIX System V Environment" that were not included in the SLS 1.03
   Linux distribution.

   The main useful response simply indicated that the 'at' and 'batch'
   commands are "Available on sunsite". I think that means the version of the
   'at' command written by Ed Carp, as mentioned above in his message from
   [1993-07-22 Thu].

   A thread with a single (zero-content) message:

   I'm including this one in my notes here mainly for completeness, with the
   excuse that the question suggests that the answer was not "just known by
