# By default the output of 'at -l' (a.k.a. atq(1)) is sorted by neither the

# We'll consume the 'at -l' format and sort it by date/time, and then by job
# number. We'll leverage the date(1) command to reformat the (potentially
# localized?) POSIX date/time info into something closer to an RFC 3339
# ("closer" because we don't emit the 'time-offset' required by section 5.6 of
# RFC 3339). The reformatted date/time field sorts naturally in ascending
# order (a fact we also leverage), but is also more easily used by downstream
# tools that may wish to sort the output in different ways (e.g., by queue,
# then by user, then by date).
#
# XXX: Future versions of the program might want to provde a number of
#      '--by-FOO' command line options (where FOO is one of 'datetime',
#      'job-number', 'queue-name', or 'user-name') to allow the user to alter
#      our baked-in sort order.
