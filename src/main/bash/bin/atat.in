# ("closer" because we don't emit the 'time-offset' required by section 5.6 of
# RFC 3339). The reformatted date/time field sorts naturally in ascending

=head1 NAME

  atat - Sort and pretty-print the output of 'at -l' (a.k.a. atq(1))


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  atat {-h|--help}
  atat {-v|--version}

  atat [OPTION...] [--] [ATQ_OPTION...]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Answers the question: "When are my L<at(1)> jobs gonna run at?"

The C<atat> program pretty-prints the output of C<at -l> to show L<at(1)> jobs
in the order in which they will occur ("execution order"), and with the date
and time fields formatted in a way that is more easily (than the default
output) consumed by downstream tools in a *nix pipeline.


=head2 Motivation

The default output of C<at -l> is prescribed by the POSIX specs. Specifically,
it states:

=over 4

In the POSIX locale, the following shall be written to the standard output for
each job when jobs are listed in response to the -l option:

    "%s\t%s\n", at_job_id, <date>

where date shall be equivalent in format to the output of:


    date +"%a %b %e %T %Y"

The date and time written shall be adjusted so that they appear in the
timezone of the user (as determined by the TZ variable).

=back

In practice, the output of C<at -l> looks something like this:

    $ at -l
    39      Wed Jun 24 03:00:00 2020 a ads
    37      Sun Dec 20 03:00:00 2020 a ads

    44      Sat Apr 24 03:00:00 2021 a ads
    48      Fri Apr 24 03:00:00 2020 a ads
    47      Mon May 25 03:00:00 2020 a ads
    52      Thu Mar 25 03:00:00 2021 a ads
    43      Tue Nov 24 03:00:00 2020 a ads
    41      Sat Jul 25 03:00:00 2020 a ads
    40      Mon Feb 22 03:00:00 2021 a ads
    51      Tue Aug 25 03:00:00 2020 a ads

Notice that the jobs are neither presented in execution order nor even by job
number.

The default output of C<atat> (shown below) sorts the L<at(1)> jobs by the
order in which they will be executed, and secondarily by job number:

    $ atat
    48 2020-04-24 03:00:00 a ads
    47 2020-05-25 03:00:00 a ads
    39 2020-06-24 03:00:00 a ads
    41 2020-07-25 03:00:00 a ads
    51 2020-08-25 03:00:00 a ads
    49 2020-09-24 03:00:00 a ads
    45 2020-10-25 03:00:00 a ads
    43 2020-11-24 03:00:00 a ads
    37 2020-12-20 03:00:00 a ads
    50 2021-01-25 03:00:00 a ads
    40 2021-02-22 03:00:00 a ads
    52 2021-03-25 03:00:00 a ads
    44 2021-04-24 03:00:00 a ads
    38 2021-05-25 03:00:00 a ads
    36 2021-06-24 03:00:00 a ads
    46 2021-07-25 03:00:00 a ads
    42 2021-08-25 03:00:00 a ads

Note that (unlike the default output of L<at(1)>) the C<atat> output can be
easily sorted by other criteria, as well, by downstream tools. For example, to
sort by queue name, then by user, then by job sequence, then by job number one
could do this:

    $ atat | sort -k4,4 -k5,5 -k2,2 -k3,3 -k1,1


=head1 OPTIONS

Below are the command line options currently accepted by C<atat>.

Any options provided on the command line that are not recognized directly by
C<atat> will be passed through to the L<atq(1)> subprocess. You can use the
C<--> pseudo-option to force the end of options processing for C<atat>, as
described below.


=over 4

=item --help

Print help usage message


=item -V, --version

Print the version of the program to stdout and then exit.


=item -v, --verbose

Turn on verbose mode. Causes program to emit messages on C<stderr> indicating
what it is doing. The option may be specified multiple times to increase
further the level of verbosity. One C<-v> option enables info-level output;
two such opts enable debug-level output; three or more enable trace-level
output.

Accumulating "verbose" option; tell what is being done. May be specified more
than once; each additional instance of the option enables an additional amount
of ouput on stderr thus:

=over 4

=item * One C<-v> opt produces info-level messages.

=item * Two C<-v> opts enables debug-level messages, too.

=item * Three or more C<-v> options turns on tracing (set -x)

=back


=item --

Signals the end of options and disables further options processing. Any
remaining command line arguments will be passed through to atq(1).

You can use the C<--> pseudo-option to force the end of options processing for
C<atat>; all options after the C<--> on the command line will be passed
through to L<atq(1)> even if they happen to match one of the C<atat> option
names.

For maximum portability, it is recommended to always use the C<-->
pseudo-option to make explict the intent that certain options should be passed
through to L<atq(1)>, especially when C<atat> is used in scripts.

=back


=head1 EXIT STATUS

Exits with zero on success, non-zero on error.


=head1 STANDARDS

=over 4

=item * The Single Unix Specification version 4, 2018 Edition ("SUSv4")

The SUSv4 standard's core volumes are simultaneously the IEEE Portable
Operating System Interface (POSIX) standard and the ISO/IEC 9945 standard.

The Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1-2017 describes the commands and
utilities offered to application programs by POSIX-conformant systems.

The L<at(1)> command, including the C<at -l> invocation described above, is
prescribed in the "Shell and Utilities" volume of the POSIX standard.

The SUSv4 standard can be obtained from The Open Group here (requires login):
